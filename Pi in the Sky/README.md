Official project page for Owen and Luca's Pi in the Sky project!

We wanted to create a handsized two-wheeled drone that could drive, strafe, and most importantly, jump. In addition to these mobility features the drone would have a one camera positioned on the front of the body, which would have a feed that is viewable from your phone. Another feature of the drone would be it's size.

We based our project off of some real world as well as fictional inspiration:

The recon drones used in the video game *Tom Clancy's: Rainbow Six Siege*

## Resources

+ Pi Zero
+ Wires
+ Accelerometer
+ Camera
+ Mecanum wheels
+ Motors

## Constraints

+ Size - we want the body of the drone to be able to fit in someoneâ€™s hand. This will be hard because it means we have to be compact with our wiring and organization of the drone.
+ Durability - Because our drone is going to have many parts and will be jumping around, we need to make it strong enough to survive multiple impacts. The durability also matters because in the game that inspired this project, the drones are tossed into windows and through doorframes. This is not a necessary ability for our drone to have but it would certainly be cool.
+ Time - Time is probably the greatest constraint because we only gave ourselves one semester to finish this
+ Aesthetic - It might be hard to make it look how it does in game.
