Official project page for Owen and Luca's Pi in the Sky project!

We wanted to create a handsized two-wheeled drone that could drive, strafe, and most importantly, jump. In addition to these mobility features the drone would have a one camera positioned on the front of the body, which would have a feed that is viewable from your phone.

We based our project off of some real world as well as fictional inspiration:

The recon drones used in the video game *Tom Clancy's: Rainbow Six Siege*
